  <h3>a class group project in which we built a prototype extension of the Chase banking app that assists users with budgeting and saving their money*</h3>

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>Overview.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <h5>The extension implements a Budget feature, which helps users to track their spending and build up their savings. Users may set an overall limit as well as limits for individual spending categories for a corresponding time period (week/month/year). They can then get an overview of their spending progress towards each limit by the same time periods. The feature also incentivises saving money, by tracking the uses remaining funds and allowing the user to transfer those remaining funds to their savings account at the end of the categories assigned limit time period, through a feature called Autosave.
        <br><br>Skills: ui/ux design, visual design, user testing, rapid prototyping, user research, wireframing.
        <br><br>Tools: Figma, Adobe Sparkpost.

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>Background.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <h5>Design prompt: Use a well-known banking app to extend or redesign a feature that helps a specific type of user to save for a major upcoming high-cost purchase.
      </h5>
      <br><p>We chose this prompt because, as of now, 63% of all smartphone users have at least one financial app. Within the US alone, 50% of working adults and 70% of millennials use mobile banking. Despite that the current availability of tools to help users with their money management within their own banking apps is largely lacking, forcing users to resort to alternative, external money management apps like Mint or You Need a Budget. As college students, we are well aware of the importance and need for saving money in order to pay for our expensive tuition.
        <br><br>We decided to work with the Chase banking app since it is the #1 most visited bank portal in the US according to the 2018 JP Morgan Annual Report and ⅔ of our team members are Chase app users themselves.
        </p>
        <h5><br>Our target users were Chase banking app users, primarily college students, new professionals, and those with especially high cost expenditures.
        <br><br>The goal was to provide a tool that assists them with money management and spending control so that they may consistently achieve progress towards long and short term saving goals in an efficient manner.

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>User Research & Findings: Refining Our Concept.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <h5>In order to understand how people manage their finances so that we could make informed decisions on how to support them, we devised a few research goals:
      </h5>
      <br><p>	→	 Verifying whether “saving for a major upcoming high-cost purchase” was a valid need
      <br>	→	 Learn what tactics our users currently employ when trying to plan & make a high cost purchase
      <br>	→	Learn about user's experience, wants, and needs regarding their banking apps
      </p>
      <h5>
      <br>A Google form questionnaire was utilized to collect the bulk of our data. Questions dealt with topics like users’ frequency of  “saving for a major purchase”, how they currently save, which banking or budgeting app they use, the functionalities they feel are lacking, and functionalities they look forward to. Through this method, we were able to obtain data from 21 people matching our target users and gain insight to some common usage trends and pain points. Participants were fellow class members, fellow Facebook group members, and acquaintances. Using results from the questionnaire, where were able to structure our interviews.
      </h5>
      <br><p>Survey quick takeaways:
      <br><br>	→	 81% of survey takers were 19-25 years old, with an overall age span participants being 19-41+.
      <br>	→	 We received 57.1% responses from males and 42.9% responses from females.
      </p>
      <h5><br><br>As a whole, we conducted 6 in person interviews with more people who matched the demographics of or target users. Interviewees, found through outreach at school and in our neighborhoods, consisted of 4 working adults and 2 college students who received allowances from their guardians. Interviews allowed us to achieve a more detailed understanding of the user's perspective in terms of money management behaviors, saving habits, and current app usability.
        <br><br>Problem statement: Our research made us realize that we needed to pivot our focus from helping our target users “save for a major purchase” to “manage their spending and build their savings”, as that is a more practical and widespread need. Additionally, users feel that their banking apps are lacking an intuitive user experience and an organized UI for tracking expenses, so we aimed to improve those aspects as well.

    <div class="container content-description">
      <h5>In order to draw some inspiration and to see what we could do better, we also performed a competitive audit of several similar existing apps or services which perform tasks similar to what we aimed for.
      </h5>
      <br><p>BB&T Banking<br>BB&T is a small bank based in North Eastern US. Their app allows budgeting for mortgages, loans, and spending. According to our research, their banking services are not as developed as major banks, however their mobile app still offers some of the best functionalities.
      <br><br>Mint<br>Mint attracts many users with its clean design and intuitive UX flows, but it might raise security concerns and it often has delays in updating the data since it is an external budgeting app. The required repetitive refreshing can be easily avoided by integrating its features into a banking app.
      <br><br>Bank of America<br>Bank of America updated their mobile app on Oct 22, and their budgeting feature seems to have been removed. The alert to prevent overdrafts is more obvious now but expenses are more difficult to track without categories.
      <br><br>Chase Desktop<br>The 10+ default categories for budgeting might be too overwhelming for some users and a mobile device interface. The feature shown is currently only accessible by credit card users. When we design the feature for its mobile app, we can provide access to debit card users and simplify the desktop design for mobile style.

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>User Flow & UI Sketches.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <h5>After compiling feedback and the user personas, we decided to create a user flow based on budgeting for Chase debit app users. Similar to other budgeting apps we organized the expenses into categories, which could have limits set on them. In the case that someone gets close to or goes over their limit, a notification will be sent to their phone. The sections in gray font are pre-existing Chase features while sections in white font are proposed.
      </h5>
      <br><p>Each group member constructed their own UI sketch for the extension, so that as a group we were able to increase our creativity and really narrow down the elements we each found essential to our development.

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>A/B Testing.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <h5>To begin the user testing for our UI, we created two prototypes from our UI sketches.
      <br><br>
      **images coming soon**
      </h5>
      <h5>For our user testing interview methodology, we first let the participants freely explore each prototype. Afterwards we provided them with a few tasks to test each UI variations such as reviewing food expenditures/transactions, changing their budget notification settings to 90%, creating a category called “Clothes” and setting its monthly limit to $100, deleting a category, and reordering the order in which the categories are displayed, so that the “Food” category is below the “Fun” category. Lastly, we asked them to explain what they understood from the overview of each UI prototype, and whether or not it showed them all of the information they cared about.
      </h5>
      <h5>Here are some of the common issues we identified from interviews:
      </h5>
      <br><p>→	The “Overview” of prototype A (using the circle), though aesthetically pleasing, is difficult to understand. Intuitively, the used vs unused funds bars from prototype B is better.<br>→	The icon for reorder and menu being the same on the “Management” tab causes confusion as to what exactly tapping on the icon does in terms of function.<br>→	The description for the autosave feature in prototype B appears too crammed on the page and is not descriptive enough. But the autosave feature in prototype A is missing entirely and felt to be needed.
      </p>
      <h5>Here are some of the common positive aspects we identified from interviews:
      </h5>
      <br><p>→ Persons we interviewed enjoyed the overall consistency of design in both prototypes.<br>→ Most of the functions present were intuitive to use and deemed useful.<br>→ The options for weekly, monthly, and quarterly were thought to be helpful.
      </p>
      <h5>Using the feedback from our user testing interviews, we identified some next steps and improvements we could make to our prototype including:
      </h5>
      <p>→ Overview: Judging from user feedback the bars in prototype B are more intuitive to understand, but the overall display needs some aesthetic improvements.<br>→ Reorder: It should appear only inside edit feature. More explicit icons and text for functions should be used.<br>→ Autosave: Put question mark icon next to it, when clicked it shows a popup with a more thorough description.

<div class="container content" id="highfidelity">
  <h2 class="display-4"><br>High Fidelity Prototype.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <h5>Our prototype is designed to help users budget their spending by setting their own categorical limits. The “Budget” feature will be located in the “Move Money” section in the main side menu tab. Users will first be directed to the “Overview” page which will display their premade categories and their progress towards their limit, which testers had found to be more reliable in bar graph form. While the category colors in the existing budgeting feature for credit cards uses 23 different colors, we only selected conservative blues that already existed in the Chase app to keep the overall look of the app consistent. As testers recommended, the exact limit along with the percentage is shown with the “Total Spending” circle graph in this prototype whereas our paper prototype only had the percentage. Users can shift to a weekly, monthly, and annual spending limit, which is mathematically derived from the Total Monthly Limit that they set in the “Manage” page. Upon selecting a bar category, the section will show their transactions for that category and time frame in a drop down. The transactions had previously existed as extra information in the “Manage” section in the paper prototype, however seeing it in Figma, we realized we did not have a clear button for it and it didn’t match with the Chase app’s simple UI, so it was moved to the “Overview” page instead to add more relevant information. <br><br>In our “Manage” page, we allow users to edit or add their categories and limits. First, there are to determine how much they want to spend monthly so we can calculate the Other category. Since the users set up the categories of spending that they want to track, we have no way of categorizing other expenditures but still want to alert users of too much spending. Thus money not currently being budgeted is sent into a “Other” category that is equal to Total Limit - Sum of Selected Categories’ Limits. Chase has AI for budgeting that automatically categorizes each credit card purchase into one of 23 different categories, so we wanted to extend this to debit card users as well. While the paper prototype initially used the pen icon to “edit” (as in the alternative design), when we more closely examined the Chase app we realized that all of the existing features used drop-down arrows, so this was changed to match the current layout. Users can add the category from a drop down of 23 existing Chase categories and set their limit. They can also opt in to the Autosave feature as well. <br><br>The Autosave feature is a feature that currently exists within Chase to automatically send a set amount of money to one’s savings account every week. We wanted to help users save money not only by limiting their spending but also by integrating parts of Chase’s current design. By opting to Autosave, the remaining money in their limit for their category that they do not use (within their budgeted limit) will be sent into a savings account. A pop up of the Autosave feature was added by clicking on the Information icon. From the paper prototype, testers liked the idea of having the information however thought that it had looked cluttered, so they asked that it wasn’t in the box at the beginning but still found it necessary so we made it into the Information icon. Because Chase is already such a well made and thorough app, one of our goals was to incorporate other existing features and here Autosave fit the bill. <br><br>Lastly, to enforce the budgeting concept, we added Alerts to notify our users of when they were nearing their spending limit. This was another way of making users save by warning them via an app alert, an email alert, or a text alert. While Chase does offer statistics and monthly reports, we found these to be ineffective if the user had already spent more than they had allocated, especially since many of our interviewees said they checked the app rarely other than to track their expenses.
      <br><br>
      </h5>
      <p>→ Overview Alternate: The original and alternate versions of the overview screens both aim to provide the user with an easy way to see a summary of how much they have spent versus how much is left in their budget in a given time period (week/month/year). The alternate screen however, uses two visualization techniques (the circle graph and bar graph) as opposed to just the bar graph in the original. In our prototype user feedback, we learned that users thought the bar graph were very clear and straightforward but the circle graph was aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, in this version, we chose to implement both.<br><br>The second difference is the method by which users choose which budget time frame they want to view. The original employs a text button style layout, where the selected time frame label is highlighted. In the alternate version, there is a drop down menu instead so that users - as the TA noted - might be less likely to get confused by the other time frames still being visible on the screen.<br><br> The third difference is the way users may view their transactions on the page. In the original, users tap on the name of the category, the category is highlighted, a bar with the same category label appears below with a drop down of the transactions from that category  (listed in reverse chronological order). In the alternate version, the category name and its corresponding bar graph form a bar, which when tapped, creates a drop down of of the transactions from that category (listed in reverse chronological order).<br><br>Lastly, the original utilizes a more conservative color palette and smaller text sizes for category names whereas the alternate uses additional colors to signify the progression of spending towards the total budget amount in the circle graph, uses larger text for the category labels, and displays the "Current Possible Savings" users have left over after their spending.
      </p>
      <br><p>→ Manage Alternate: Both versions have the functionalities of editing a category and adding a category, but the alternative version explores the usage of a symbol for “edit”, the removal of redundant display of a category’s name when editing, the homogeneous conceptual model for “edit” and “add”, and the standout display of Autosave description.<br><br>The alternative symbol better conveys the functionality of “edit”; it’s more straightforward than the original design. When users edit the category “Food & Drink”, they will see this title twice in the original design. However in the alternative one, the whole category bar is replaced by an edit box, which is more minimal and concise.<br><br>By moving the “Add a category” to the top and creating similar frameworks for “add” and “edit” box, we’re able to provide similar user experiences for both functionalities. The homogeneous conceptual model for “edit” and “add” lowers users’ learning curve, as well as reducing the workload of developing and implementing. If a solution provides the same level of user experience with a lower cost, it’s worth considering for the company.<br><br>Lastly, in the alternative design, the description of Autosave info is put into a light-blue container. This removes a sense of crowdedness in the original design, and it also helps users focus on the information that they try to access. With this alternative design, we will be able to test on different perspectives with users, maximizing the findings and insights gained from each user testing.
      </p>
      <br><h5>For our final iteration of our prototype, we made some changes based on TA and additional user feedback:
      </h5>
      <br><p>→ Overview page: Despite TA feedback that the “View this” time frame adjustment buttons in our original version might be a bit confusing to the user, users seemed to favor that method over the drop down in the alternate version. Thus, the button concept was kept in the improved version of the page with a minor adjustment where the “View this” text appears directly over the time frame button the user chose for clarity.<br><br>According to both user and TA feedback, the functionality for users to view their recent transactions was not apparent since there was no indication that the categories were clickable or expanding in the original. Therefore in the improved version, we used the method from the alternate version where each category was contained within a bar that had a drop down icon to signify its ability to be clicked and expanded.<br><br>Overall, most users liked the alternate Overview page more than the original one since it had a clearer way of showing the “Total Spent” and offered a “Total Possible Savings” feature. However, they felt there was a lack of white space and the circle graph was a bit distracting from the other parts of the screen, so we made the circle graph a bit smaller and thinner and included the “Total Spent” and “Total Possible Savings” features in the improved version.
        </p>
        <br><p>→ Manage page: Users liked the compactness of the original manage main page, so we kept that consistent in the improved version. Users liked the blue containers we used for the Autosave description in the alternate screens because they felt it broke up the information well and made it easier to read, so we also carried that over ot the improved version.
        </p>
        <br><p>→ We also added screens which guide first-time users where users will see an introduction of Budget feature and set up their total monthly limit. After clicking “Start Budgeting,” there will be a thorough step-by-step guide, especially friendly for users who have less exposure to apps or technology. By clicking the “x” on the top right, users can exit the guide anytime they wish.
