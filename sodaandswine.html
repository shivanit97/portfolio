  <h2 class="display-4"><br>Overview.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">   
      <h5><br>Soda & Swine is a San Diego based restaurant chain, dedicated to providing patrons with a quality food and drink experience. 
      Their UC San Diego location, specifically, prides itself on being an escape from usual campus life for students and faculty. 
    The design concept includes both desktop and mobile prototypes, with a mobile first approach. 
    Our team of 4 aimed to create something that was equally visually appealing and functional, while adhering to the management's standards and ultimate goal of getting people into the restaurant. 
    Site highlights include its high quality imagery, thorough display of information, and easy to use interface. 
    General design principles and some typical restaurant website features are implemented so that navigation is seamless for users. 
    My partner and I worked on the mobile interface.
      <br><br>Roles/Skills: <em>ui/ux design, web + mobile interface design, visual design,</em> rapid prototyping, user testing, user research, and wireframing..
        <br><br>Tools: <em>Figma</em>.

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>Background.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <br><p>  As it stands, the current website lists the essentials such as location, hours and menu but doesn’t include anything about the specials, events, 
      or background of the restaurant. The majority of the restaurant's online presence has been through social media such as Instagram and Facebook. 
      Facebook currently only has basic information such as location and hours. 
      Instagram, as expected, is only a visual presence with many high quality photos of the food and interiors. 
      The manager feels that Instagram is the more successful one of the two since photos pique people's interest more than just the text on menus could.

        <br><br>In terms of aesthetics and function, every detail of the restaurant itself is very well thought out. 
        From the seating types to the absence of outlets, each aspect serves an essential purpose. 
        We strived to be just as deliberate with our design choices for the restaurant's website. 
        The three words the manager used to describe his ideal restaurant (funky, unique and direct) point to a very sleek and artsy but also functional website design. 
        We started by drawing inspiration from the colors and the vintage yet modern feel the restaurant uses in its current branding. 
        In the end, the website should be more visual than text heavy, as photos have been more effective by far in grabbing people's attention. 
        </p>
        <h5><br>The goal for the website is to incorporate these qualities and more to give a well rounded experience for users visiting the page and give them more reasons to visit.

    <div class="container content-description">
      
      <p>We interviewed 3 people each for different categories of potential customers for the restaurant, including students, faculty, and those not directly 
      affiliated with the campus. Based on these interviews, we were able to construct three personas that summed up the wants, needs, and goals for each 
      of the consumer types.

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>Competitive Audit.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
    <h5>For this competitive analysis we looked at a few restaurants that are potential competitors: BJ’s Restaurant, Ballast Point Brewing Company, Taproom, Eureka!, and Dirty Birds. We found a few areas where many of their websites overlapped.
    </h5>
    
    <br><p>
    All of the places displayed the menu, location(s), hours, social media, and contact info on their websites. 
    <br><br>Most also included catering, online ordering, about me, and careers pages.  
    On average the websites have a good balance of visual and textual content. 
    High quality images show off the food, beverages, and restaurant spaces. Descriptive text informs users what to expect. 
    <br><br>
    After analyzing these competitors websites, we formulated some ideas for what Soda & Swines website redesign should entail. 
    We wanted to make key information easily accessible, navigation intuitive, and iconography recognizable, while keeping their 
    existing branding and our newfound insights in mind.

    <div class="container content-description">
      <h5>Iteration 1 (Simple Black/White):
      </h5><br>
      <br><br><p>
        The first design we came up with was no frills, all function. 
        Stylistic touches took a backseat, while more minimalist, streamlined style came through. 
        Every food and drink item included an image, its name and a description. 
        Aside from this the only visual elements were on a very concise homepage, which consisted of a banner image and an image carousel. 
        The catering page only had the inquiry form, no menu. Though the design was straightforward, it was very boring.
      </p>
      <h5>Iteration 2 (Color w/ images):
      </h5>
      <p>→ This version started to incorporate some style. 
      The addition of color, font styles, and some familiar iconography made the menus more closely align the ones you received in store.
      The image carousel on the homepage had descriptions for each item shown.
      The number of images used on menus was reduced for a more clean look and increased on the event page to draw in more attention. 
      Key information for the restaurant is located at the bottom of every page.

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>High Fidelity Prototypes.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <br><p class="text-center">Major improvements made to the home, catering, and contact pages. 
      The landing image on the homepage now makes it crystal clear that you are on Soda & Swine website.
      The carousel on the homepage now has links to the menus for each item type.
      The catering page now includes the actual catering menu so that customers know what their options are. 
      The contact page includes an image of what the restaurant looks like from the outside so that it is easier to find. 
      Additional images and other essential impressions have been added. 
      Stylistic changes such as image treatments and icons were introduced in order to make the design more consistent with the in store displays.

  <h2 class="display-4"><br>Reflection.</h2><br>
    <div class="container content-description">
      <br><p>
          This project was the first time I've ever interacted with an actual "client" and had to create something that had potential of being implemented in real life. 
          I had to challenge myself to think creatively, but on someone else's terms, while still being mindful of what users would like. 
          There were times of difficulty, especially when the client was unresponsive, however we learned to work around this to gather what we needed from whatever content and information they already had available online and elsewhere. 
          I have always known that iterating on your designs is always the best way to come up with better results, but this was even more necessary when designing for desktop and mobile. 
          Staying consistent while upholding the clients standards on both platforms was tricky, but trying many different approaches is what ultimately gave us our current design. 
          I was fortunate enough to have a great team that was enjoyable to work with. I learned the value of good communication, interpersonal relationships, and being present. 
          We were able to work efficiently and effectively by being honest in our process and always asking each other for help when necessary.
